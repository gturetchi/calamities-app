        The Metric View page displays _aggregated statistics_ for the main
        EM-DAT _impact variables_ in the dataset or its filtered selection.
        The numbers are calculated using the provided EM-DAT file. Users may
        use the :point_left: sidebar filters to explore subsets of the data.

        **Impact Variables**

        - **N° Count**: disaster occurrences at the country level,
        - **Total Deaths**: associated mortality, including long-term missing
        people,
        - **Total Affected**: total number of affected people necessitating
        assistance, including injured, homeless, and otherwise affected,
        - **Total Dam. ('000 US\$')**: total economic damage reported in
        thousands of \$US, adjusted for inflation.

        **Aggregated Statistics**

        - **Total**: total for the corresponding impact variables,
        - **Yearly Average**: the expected impact, on average, per year,
        - **Yearly Median**: the expected impact, using the median, per year,
        such that 50% of years are expected to have more or less than the
        median.
        - **Reporting %**: the reporting percentage for the corresponding impact
        variables, indicating the rate at which EM-DAT reports the impact
        figure in the selected disaster entries. Non-reported impacts could
        either be null or unknown.

        **Distribution per Disaster Types (%)**

        The bar chart show the distribution of the total impact, for each
        considered impact variable, expressed as the percentage of total in the
        dataset or its filtered selection.

    The Table View page displays a multi-selection of columns and their data
    content based on the EM-DAT uploaded dataset or its filtered selection.
    Users may use the :point_left: sidebar filters to explore subsets of the

    **Columns Selection**

    User may use the :point_up_2: multiselect tool to filter the columns to
    display. For a complete description of the column variables, we refer to
    the [EM-DAT Public Table](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/emdat-public-table/)

    median.

    **Color Scales**

    Color scales can be selected based on those available from the `plotly`
    graphing libraries. More info: https://plotly.com/python/builtin-colorscales/.

    Alternatively, the user can use a custom color scale, enabled by the
    :point_up_2: "Custom Color Scale" toggle button.

    **Troubleshooting**

    World maps are built using an attribute joint on ISO-3166 alpha-3 codes.
    EM-DAT contains some code for historical data or conflictual areas that
    may not be mapped using the reference used by the `plotly` graphing library.
    For a list of these exceptions and additional information, see
    [Spatial Information and Geocoding](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/spatial-information).

    **Disclaimer**

    This tool relies on the world delineation provided the `plotly` graphing
    library. The way the EM-DAT data is presented and documented on this app
    does not reflect any geopolitical views held by the EM-DAT team, or the
    views of our partners, including the United States Agency for International
